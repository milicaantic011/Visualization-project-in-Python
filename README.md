# COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on applying Python libraries for **data visualization**, including **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Dash** to analyze the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The project is divided into several parts that, when combined, form a comprehensive analysis of pandemic trends worldwide.

---

##  Development Setup
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `dash`
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **Final Output**: Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb` format)

---

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the GitHub repository of **[Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)**, which provides a comprehensive knowledge base on the **COVID-19 pandemic (2020 onward)**.

For the purposes of this project:
- Unnecessary columns were removed
- Geographic coordinates were added for mapping visualizations

**File used**: `project_1_python.csv`

---

## Data Cleaning
During the project, **rows with missing values (`NaN`) were removed** for the selected metrics.
This ensured that all visualizations only included valid and complete data for accurate representation.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to **analyze the course of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide**, focusing on:
- Dynamics of cases and deaths over time
- Testing rates and effectiveness
- Hospitalization patterns
- Vaccination progress across countries
- Demographic factors affecting pandemic impact

##  Solution
A comprehensive data visualization and analysis notebook developed in **Visual Studio Code**, with the final solution exported as a `*.ipynb` file containing:
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly
- Statistical analysis with Seaborn
- Geographic mapping of pandemic spread
- Time series analysis of case trends
- Demographic correlation studies
