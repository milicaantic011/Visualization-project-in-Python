#  Airline Delays Exploratory Data Analysis

**An in-depth exploratory data analysis of U.S. airline delays comparing December 2019 vs December 2020 performance using Python data analysis libraries.**

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes airline delay patterns in the United States, focusing on the comparison between **December 2019** (pre-pandemic) and **December 2020** (during pandemic) to understand how COVID-19 impacted flight operations.

##  Dataset Description

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|--------------|------------|
| **Source** | [Kaggle Airline Delays Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eugeniyosetrov/airline-delays) |
| **Timeframe** | December 2019 and December 2020 |

- `weather_ct` — Weather-related delay counts
- `nas_ct` — National Airspace System delay counts
- `security_ct` — Security-related delay counts
- `late_aircraft_ct` — Late aircraft delay counts
- `arr_cancelled` — Cancelled flights
- `arr_diverted` — Diverted flights

##  Tech Stack

| **Component** | **Technology** |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.11 |
| **Environment** | Jupyter Notebook |

### **Libraries Used:**
- **`pandas`** — Data manipulation and analysis
- **`numpy`** — Numerical computing

##  Analysis Goals

1. **Delay Pattern Analysis**  
   Identify main contributors to flight disruptions

2. **Carrier Performance Comparison**  
   Compare delay performance across different airlines

3. **Geographic Analysis**  
   Explore delay patterns across U.S. airports

4. **Pandemic Impact Assessment**  
   Compare 2019 vs 2020 flight operations

5. **Root Cause Analysis**  
   Determine primary causes of delays and cancellations

---

##  Key Insights

The analysis explores:
- **Pandemic Impact**: How COVID-19 affected flight volumes and delay patterns
- **Carrier Performance**: Which airlines had best/worst on-time performance
- **Geographic Patterns**: Delay hotspots across U.S. airports
- **Delay Causes**: Relative impact of weather, carrier issues, system delays, etc.

##  Key Visualizations

### **1. Correlation Matrix Heatmap**
![Correlation Heatmap](visualizations/correlation_heatmap.png)

Visual analysis of relationships between different delay types, flight volumes, and cancellations to identify patterns and dependencies

### **2. Top Airlines by Delay Rate**
![Airlines Delays](visualizations/airlines_delays.png)

Comparative ranking of carriers based on percentage of delayed flights, highlighting best and worst performing airlines

### **3. Top Airports by Delay Rate**
![Airports Delays](visualizations/airports_delays.png)

Geographic analysis identifying the most problematic airports with highest delay percentages across the U.S.

### **4. Delay Types Distribution**
![Delay Types Pie Chart](visualizations/delay_types_pie.png)

Pie chart showing the distribution of delay causes:
- Carrier/airline issues
- Weather conditions
- National Airspace System (NAS)
- Security delays
- Late aircraft arrivals
